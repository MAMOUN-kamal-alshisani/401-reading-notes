## Readings: Data Modeling

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development :

1. ***Easier to maintain***

3. ***Easier to refactor*** 
 
5. ***High test coverage***

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite

***before() is run once before all the tests in a describe***
***beforeEach() is run before each test in a describe***

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development :

***the actual database or external file is never tested directly by TDD (only production code can test it)***

## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

***ES6 classes is like a container that holds the constructor and the methods associated with your instantiated object.***

## Why REST?

***its like creating knowledge of actions that happened before the client made the request and what will or should happen after the response is sent back to the client. REST is used when you are talking to your API***

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### functional programming :

***Functional Programming is based more on calculations and returning a mathemetical value. “What to solve” versus “how to solve”. This is also supported in Javascript.***

### object-oriented programming (OOP)

***is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).***

### class

***Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.***

### super :

***the super keyword in JavaScript is used in order to call the methods of the parent class. By itself, super() is used within a constructor function to call the parent constructor function***

### this :

***he JavaScript “this” keyword has a special meaning inside of that object: it refers to itself. In other words, when you create your constructor function, you can use the “this” keyword to reference the object that WILL be created when the constructor is instantiated***

### ‪Test Driven Development (TDD)‬

***In layman's terms, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines programming, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring***

### jest

***is an open-source testing framework built on JavaScript, designed majorly to work with React and React Native based web applications.***

### Continuous integration (CI):

***Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.***

### REST :

***is an architectural style that handles the client-server relationship, with the purpose of aiming for speed and performance by using re-usable components.***

### data model :

***A data model organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. Since data elements document real life people, places and things and the events between them, the data model represents reality.***
