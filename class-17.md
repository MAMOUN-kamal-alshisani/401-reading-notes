## Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda



### Describe “The Cloud” :
***The definition for the cloud can seem murky, but essentially, it’s a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.***

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
***A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.***

### What is auto-scaling?
***AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. You can optimize availability, costs, or a balance of both. AWS Auto Scaling automatically creates all of the scaling policies and sets targets for you based on your preference.***

### What is bandwidth?
***The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).***

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
***Cloud services are billed based on the duration of time your service was deployed for. If your instance was deployed for less than an hour, or multiple hours plus some fraction of hour, you will be charged for that duration only.***

## Term

### Server Instances
***A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately.***

### Containers

### Cloud Services
***refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.***

### Cloud Architecture
***Cloud architecture is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds —IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. Cloud architecture is how all the components and capabilities necessary to build a cloud are connected in order to deliver an online platform on which applications can run.***

### AWS
***The AWS Management Console brings the unmatched breadth and depth of AWS right to your computer or mobile phone with a secure, easy-to-access, web-based portal. Discover new services, manage your entire account, build new applications, and learn how to do even more with AWS. Get started fast with the AWS Management Console.***

### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
***Build, deliver, monitor and scale web apps and APIs with a trail blazing developer experience. Heroku is a cloud application platform – a new way of building and deploying web apps. Heroku lets app developers spend 100% of their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling. Amazon EC2 can be classified as a tool in the "Cloud Hosting" category, while Heroku is grouped under "Platform as a Service".***
