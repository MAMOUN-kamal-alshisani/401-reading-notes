# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

***The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret (see RFC7616 and RFC7617).***

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
* don’t create a weak secret.
* don’t store it in a plain text.
* don’t share your secret with anyone.
* make a rotation for your secret.
* don’t use same secret for different accounts.
