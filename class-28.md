# adding: Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook


### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

***becuase the React is a single page application and only contains and renders one HTML page always.***

### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
* Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
* Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
* **Inside a <_Route />**
### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

### What does props.children contain?
***My simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. Hereâ€™s an example of a stateless function that is used to create a component.***

### How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
***The only difference between the functional component and the class component at this point is instead of calling this.setState we use the function we created in the useState, in this case, setValue. setState () vs useState () - Objects. Since state in a class component is already an object, it's business as usual.***

## Term
### State Hook
***They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.***

### Mounting and Un-Mounting :
***A React component's lifecycle contains distinct phases for creation and deletion. In coding terms, these are called mounting and unmounting. You can also think of them as "setup" and "cleanup".***
