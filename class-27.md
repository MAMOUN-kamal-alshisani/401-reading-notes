# Reading: useState() Hook

### ```How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?```

***React breaks down the UI into smaller and reusable components that can move around data amongst each other. This breaking down of the UI is what gives React an edge over Vanilla JS. In Vanilla JS, the code becomes very difficult to maintain if the application is large because in such cases the UI needs to be updated regularly.***

### ```What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?```

***The most obvious difference is the syntax. A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. This requires more code but will also give you some benefits.***

## Term

### ```Functional Components```
***Functional Components are functions. The only constraint for a functional component is to accept props as an argument and return valid JSX.***

### ```Children / Child Components```
***child component is a component that is apart of parent component scope but not all of it.
