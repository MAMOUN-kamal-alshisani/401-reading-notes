## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

***MongoDB***

***Firebase***

***Postman***

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
***Informational responses (100-199)***

***Successful responses (200-299)***

***Redirects (300-399)***

***Client errors (400-499)***

***Server errors (500-599)***

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST :

***REST versus SOAP. It’s been an issue for a while now. And really, they’re just two answers to the same question: how to access web services.***
