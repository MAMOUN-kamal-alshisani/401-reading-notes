# Readings: Event Driven Applications

## Why is access control important?

***Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.***

## Describe an application that would need access control:

***any application that would need to limit the users access to some of its data***

## What is a role used for?

***to limit the access based on the role of the user***

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
* ``To most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead.``
* ``ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data.``
* ``while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.``

## Term

***Authorization: it basically means that whether or not the indevedual or the entity is allowed to access***

***Role Based Access Control : Role-based access control (RBAC), also known as role-based security, is an access control method that assigns permissions to end-users based on their role within your organization. RBAC provides fine-grained control, offering a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less error-prone than individually assigning permissions.***

***Capabilities : is the set of tasks or activities that a business function of an organization is potentially able to perform acquired skills at a certain level of performance available capacity, but only when it is needed***
